# A responsive personal website layout using a Bootstrap template
## A project made during an <a href="https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/2847691-maquettez-votre-site-responsive-avec-photoshop">openclassrooms.com</a> course

The idea was to first make a website layout in Photoshop and then to make a desktop and a mobile version of a portfolio website.

P.S. My current personal <a href=https://mariakaptur.com>website></a> is made with a<a href="https://mobirise.com/">MobiRise</a> application. However, I'm working its new version that I create from scrath.
